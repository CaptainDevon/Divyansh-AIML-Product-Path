multiplayer aspect has been greatly enhanced, encouraging social play and
friendly competition.

The visual fidelity of Forza Horizon 5 is nothing short of spectacular.
Leveraging the power of next-gen consoles and high-end PCs, the game features
detailed car models, lifelike lighting, and photorealistic landscapes. The audio
design is equally impressive, with each engine sounding authentic and the

Coupled with a diverse and energetic soundtrack, the game captures the
excitement of a real-life automotive festival.
