    - Evaluated model performance on synthetic datasets, achieving accurate classification and regression results.  
    - Demonstrated understanding of neural network internals and optimization techniques.

- **Traditional Machine Learning**
  - *Diabetes Prediction*:  
    - Built a predictive model for diabetes diagnosis using pandas for data manipulation and scikit-learn for   machine learning algorithms.  
    - Performed exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model selection to improve accuracy.  
    - Visualized key insights and model performance using matplotlib and seaborn.  
    - Achieved high predictive accuracy and provided actionable insights for healthcare data.

  - *Cab Fare Prediction*:  
    - Developed a regression model to predict cab fares based on trip data, leveraging data cleaning, feature extraction, and correlation analysis.  
    - Applied multiple regression algorithms and evaluated their performance using appropriate metrics.  
    - Conducted thorough exploratory data analysis to identify trends and outliers.  
    - Improved model accuracy through iterative feature selection and hyperparameter tuning.

### Natural Language Processing

- **spacy library**
  - *spacy_introduction.ipynb*:  
    - Introduced core spaCy functionalities, including text processing, tokenization, and sentence segmentation.  
    - Demonstrated practical NLP workflows for preprocessing and analyzing text data.

  - *part_of_speech.ipynb*:  
    - Extracted and visualized part-of-speech tags from text using spaCy's linguistic features.  
    - Enabled deeper syntactic analysis for downstream NLP tasks.

  - *name_entity_recognition.ipynb*:  
    - Implemented named entity recognition to identify and categorize entities in text.  
    - Visualized entity spans and types for improved interpretability.

  - *token_attributes.ipynb*:  
    - Explored token-level attributes such as lemma, POS, entity type, and dependency parsing.  
    - Provided insights into linguistic structure and relationships within text.

  - *word_vectors.ipynb*:  
    - Demonstrated the use of word vectors for semantic similarity and nearest neighbor analysis.  
    - Applied spaCy's medium model to uncover relationships between words.

### OOPS

- Developed comprehensive Python scripts and exercises covering all major object-oriented programming concepts, including:
  - Class design, constructors, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, operator overloading, static methods, and abstraction.
  - Reinforced understanding through practical examples and coding challenges.

### Python Fundamentals

- Created structured subfolders and scripts for each core Python topic:
  - Conditionals, loops, lists, dictionaries, functions, importing packages, operators, and more.
  - Included hands-on exercises and practice problems to solidify foundational programming skills.
